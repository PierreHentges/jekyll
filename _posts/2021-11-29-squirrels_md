title:  How hazel trees stop squirrels eating all the hazel nuts, using auto-correlation in pollen
categories: [pollen, mast seeding, evolution]

hazel get squirrels to disperse nuts - forget about some of them

tricks:
large & nutritious: makes it worth hiding them somewhere far , well

tough shell: once full, it's better for squirrel to hoard rather than eat immediately

tension: 

Pollen concentrations are enormously variable because it helps trees pursue evolutionary strategy.

# (on variability)
Day-to-day variation of pollen concentrations - shown in the first panel for one season of hazel pollen - is huge. If we take a step back and look at the season-to-season variability over 3 decades we can see it is also highly variable.

The daily concentrations of hazel pollen in the middle panels empasise the seasonal peak concentrations. To see see the amount of pollen in each season, we can visualise the 60-day cumulative sum of daily concentrations (bottom panel).

The year totals are also quite variable, but less random: each of the exceptionally high years (2011,2016,2019) is followed by an exceptionally low year.

(Another noticeble pattern is a trend towards higher pollen amounts - both the highest and lowest season totals appear to go up. But more on that another time.)

This interesting pattern is not simply regression to the mean, because the lows following the exceptional highs are always well below the mean.

# (mast seeding)

In fact, it is a consequence of a well known phenomenon called mast seeding. While 2011 was a golden year for squirrels who could gorge themselves on hazel nuts and still there would be lots left over, 2012 was pretty meagre.

This phenomenon doesn't just happen in hazel - and interstingly, it is to some degree synchronised between different trees:

# (autocorrelation)
For most of these trees, 2016, 2011, 2018, 2006, were above-average while 2017, 2012, 2019, 2017 were below-average (with exceptions). The name for this type of pattern is negative autocorrelation or serial correlation: the total amount of pollen produced in a season is correlated with the amount of preceding seasons. And that correlation is negative: a high tends to be followed by a low, and vice-versa.

To quantify the strength of the negative autocorrelation, we can calculate the difference between each season and the preceding one, and generate an autocorrelation plot.

The plot shows autocorrelation for different lags: the correlation between one year and 1 year, 2,3,4,..15 years later. As expected, at lag 1, there's a strong negative autocorrelation from about -0.5 to -0.7. 

For most of the trees, lag 2 is positive, with some exceptions - but this is within the blue area that indicates it's below the chosen threshold of statistical significance. We're not dealing with a simple up-down-up-down pattern: lags 5, 7 (odd numbers) tend to be positive, while lags 6, 8 (even numbers) tend to be negative. This could be part of the pattern, or it could simply be chance events, i.e. 2006-2011-2016 are 5 years apart, 2011-2018 are 7 years apart.

# how does this help trees

The mast seeding phenomenon also causes the pollen season totals to be very skewed, as shown in the boxplot below.

To see the skewness better, we can normalise the values by dividing each season total by the median of the observations, to remove the effect of the vast differences in pollen production between for example walnut and birch1 is now the value of a typical (median) year, and the values express the fold change in other years. 

What this shows is that in high-pollen years, trees don't just increase pollen by a little bit, they really go for it: the multiply their pollen output by 2,3,4 fold, and in the case of beech almost 10-fold.

This is because pollination is a key determinant in mast seeding: to produce an abundance of hazel nuts (or other seeds) in autumn, hazel need to fertilise an abundance of tree flowers in winter.
