I"ë<p>Plants release pollen in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenology">phenological</a> process : the pollen season. As pollen allergy suffers <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergen#Seasonal_allergy">know</a>, these seasons repeat every year in a similar way - but there is also great variability, at the level of daily observations, between seasons and between plants. This post presents ways of visualising pollen time-series data so to gain a sense of how a pollen season unfolds as well as how pollen seasons vary.</p>

<p>Pollen concentrations vary from day to day. On the left are daily observations of the concentration of birch pollen in 2006. It starts in mid-April, it fades out from mid-May. The bulk of pollen is seen in the second half of April. This is the main pollen season: people allergic to birch pollen will see strong symptoms when the concentration is above 50 or 100 pollen grains /mÂ³.</p>
