I"<p>I’m setting up this blog to document and reflect on some work I did on a dataset of aerobiological pollen measurements, to share methods I used and insights I gained.</p>

<p>A few weeks before last winter’s lockdown, in search for a real world dataset, mainly as an exercise for time-series analysis and visualisation as well as some predictive modelling, I started looking at data from the aerobiology station in Luxembourg (publicly available at pollen.lu).</p>

<p>It’s a great dataset, covering 30 continuous years of pollen measurements, taken at a daily frequency, of 33 different types of trees, grass and weeds. It also contains daily measurements of several types of fungal spores. The data are very clean and consistent, probably because, over the three decades, the measurements have been taken by the same team of people and the pollen trap was never moved.</p>

<p>The more I looked at the data, the more interested I got in it. Pollen research takes place at the unusual intersection of medicine (due to medical relevance of pollen allergies), botany (particularly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenology">phenology</a>, which studies periodic events of biological life cycles), and meteorology (because pollen concentrations are largely determined by weather conditions).</p>
